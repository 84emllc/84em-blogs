84EM.DEV is my web development notebook.

After years of building web applications, APIs, and frontend interfaces, I started writing down the patterns and solutions that actually hold up in production. This site is where those notes live.

## What you'll find here

Practical web development content: backend architecture, frontend patterns, WordPress when it's the right tool, and the occasional deep dive into performance or accessibility. No framework-of-the-week hype. No tutorials that only work in ideal conditions.

I write about problems I've solved for real clients, not theoretical exercises.

## Development setup

I build with AI assistance: Claude Code for development, supplemented by Codex CLI, Copilot, and Gemini Code Assist for code review and validation.
